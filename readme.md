Confucius once said, "Is it not a joy to have friends come from afar?" Thank you for visiting my profile and showing interest in my work. I maintain an English blog called [Johngai’s Tech Forge](https://johngai.com/), which I launched in early 2024. Previously, I wrote a Chinese version of the blog, [Assorted Technology Pie](https://www.weizhiyong.com), focusing on programming, design, and industrial technology since 2005. Both versions feature technical articles and insights from my professional journey.

With nearly 20 years of experience in industrial automation, IoT, and AI, I’ve evolved from mastering control systems like PLC, SCADA software, LabVIEW, and AutoCAD to leading projects that integrate AI-driven predictive maintenance, energy monitoring systems, and IoT platforms. My expertise spans programming languages like C, C++, C#, Python, and JavaScript, with significant emphasis on C#, Python, and JavaScript/TypeScript for building smart systems.

In recent years, I’ve focused on Industrial Internet and IoT product development, creating solutions for smart energy monitoring, predictive maintenance, and distributed control systems. My GitHub repositories showcase open-source contributions, including modules and tools I’ve developed for AI, machine learning, and IoT applications. Some of these projects include TextDistiller, an NLP-based text segmentation tool, and TechMart, an e-commerce prototype leveraging Next.js and Prisma.

Confucius also said, "It’s like carving and polishing, like grinding and refining." I believe in continuous learning and collaboration to refine ideas and create impactful solutions. I welcome your feedback, suggestions, and discussions. Let’s connect and innovate together!

Wishing you success and fulfillment in all your endeavors.
