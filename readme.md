I am a Senior Data Engineer, AI Architect, and IoT Innovator with over 15 years of experience designing and delivering scalable solutions that transform industries. From building advanced data pipelines and cloud-native architectures to integrating AI-driven predictive maintenance and IoT platforms, my career has been a journey of innovation, learning, and impact.

My professional expertise spans data engineering, AI, and IoT, with hands-on experience in developing systems that merge cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world challenges. I specialize in programming languages such as Python, Golang, C#, and TypeScript, leveraging frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and HuggingFace for AI applications, while building IoT and cloud-based solutions with AWS SageMaker, Lambda, and Apache Spark.

Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of leading transformative projects. As the CTO and Co-Founder of WESINX, I designed and deployed IoT platforms across 200+ highway service areas, reducing downtime by 30% through predictive analytics. My work has also included integrating financial data APIs (e.g., Bloomberg, YFinance) into AI-driven applications and developing open-source projects that showcase my passion for technology and innovation.

Confucius also said, "It’s like carving and polishing, like grinding and refining." This philosophy inspires me to continuously learn, refine, and collaborate to create meaningful solutions. I firmly believe that the future of technology lies in interdisciplinary innovation, where AI, IoT, and cloud computing converge to solve complex problems.

I welcome your feedback, discussions, and opportunities to collaborate. Let’s work together to push the boundaries of what’s possible.

Wishing you success and fulfillment in all your endeavors!
